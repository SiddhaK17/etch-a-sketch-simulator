# üñäÔ∏è Etch-a-Sketch Simulator

The **Etch-a-Sketch Simulator** is a Python-based interactive drawing application inspired by the iconic mechanical toy of the same name. This project brings nostalgic creativity into the digital age by allowing users to sketch freely on a canvas using keyboard-driven directional controls. Built with Python's native `turtle` graphics module, the simulator provides an engaging, educational experience while introducing core programming concepts such as event handling, real-time input processing, and GUI-based interaction.

It‚Äôs not just a toy; it‚Äôs a playful gateway into Python development ‚Äî perfect for beginners exploring graphical interfaces or hobbyists reliving a bit of childhood joy through code.

## üß© Overview

This project was developed as a foundational Python exercise aimed at exploring the intersection of logic, design, and interactivity. The simulator emulates the behavior of a traditional Etch-a-Sketch by enabling real-time control of a digital pen using simple keyboard inputs. Users can draw lines, turn the pen at angles, move backward and forward, and even reset the canvas ‚Äî all with intuitive key mappings.

Beyond its playful surface, this project teaches key principles of procedural and event-driven programming, offering a great way to understand how user input can directly affect visual output in a graphical environment. With minimal dependencies and clean code, it is easy to run, understand, and extend.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Concepts Used

| Category         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Language**     | Python 3.13 (or later recommended)                                          |
| **GUI Library**  | `turtle` module ‚Äî for real-time graphical output and interactive visuals    |
| **Input Handling**| `Screen.onkey()` ‚Äî to capture and map keyboard inputs to turtle actions     |
| **OOP Principles**| Utilizes the `Turtle` class to instantiate and control the drawing cursor   |
| **Event-Driven Architecture** | Responds to keyboard inputs to control drawing flow in real time  |
| **Cross-Platform Support** | Runs on any OS with Python and Tkinter support                    |

Additional environment configurations are used to ensure smooth execution on Windows systems by setting `TCL_LIBRARY` and `TK_LIBRARY` paths for `tkinter` dependencies.

## üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics

| Control Key | Functionality                               |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `W`         | Moves the turtle forward                     |
| `S`         | Moves the turtle backward                    |
| `A`         | Rotates the turtle 10¬∞ to the left (counter-clockwise) |
| `D`         | Rotates the turtle 10¬∞ to the right (clockwise)        |
| `C`         | Clears the canvas and resets the turtle to center       |

The simulator responds instantly to key presses, allowing users to draw seamlessly on the canvas. Each movement of the turtle leaves a visible trail, mimicking the behavior of a real Etch-a-Sketch. The controls are simple yet powerful, enabling the creation of freehand sketches, geometric patterns, or just experimental doodles. Pressing `C` clears the canvas and repositions the turtle at the origin, allowing users to start fresh without restarting the program.

### üöÄ How to Run

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure you have **Python 3.10+** installed.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or above
- Compatible terminal or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

1. Install the required dependencies (if not already present):
   ```bash
   pip install turtle
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/etch-a-sketch-simulator.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project folder**
   ```bash
   cd etch-a-sketch-simulator
   ```

> üí° **Optional ‚Äì Windows Only:** If you encounter errors related to `TCL_LIBRARY` or `TK_LIBRARY`, ensure that your Python installation's Tcl paths are correctly set using `os.environ` at the beginning of your script:
   ```bash
   import os
   os.environ['TCL_LIBRARY'] = r'C:\Program Files\Python313\tcl\tcl8.6'
   os.environ['TK_LIBRARY'] = r'C:\Program Files\Python313\tcl\tk8.6'
   ```

4. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
